# Journey-Through-Flare-On
My goal with this repo is to illustrate my journey through Mandiant's Flare-On challenges so I may become a better reverse engineer!

## Flare on, wut that?
FLARE-On has been a six-week CTF since 2014 by Mandiant's "Frontline Advanced Reverse Engineering" (FLARE) team. The CTF focuses on reverse engineering challenges to test current and aspiring engineers' abilities. These challenges become increasingly harder the further you get into the CTF. The first challenge could be a minute or two to complete/find, but challenge 11 could take multiple weeks.
