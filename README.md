# Journey-Through-Flare-On
My goal with this repo is to illustrate my journey through Mandiant's Flare-On challenges so I may become a better reverse engineer!

## Flare on, wut that?
Oh, I'm so glade you ask. FLARE-On is a six week CTF put on each year since 2014 by Mandiant's "Front Line Advacend Reverse Engineering" (FLARE) team. The CTF focuses mostly on reverse enginering chalangs to test curent and apring engineers in therir abiliti reverse engieer , thes chalanges get increasel hader the further you get in the CTF. So 1 chalange 1's flag could be a minute or ttwo to complete/find, but the chalange 11 could take yu muliple weeks or more to complete.
